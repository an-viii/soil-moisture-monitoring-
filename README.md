# ðŸ’§ Soil Moisture Monitoring Project

## Overview

This repository contains all the code, documentation, and media for a *Soil Moisture Monitoring System* designed to track and record the moisture levels of soil using an *ESP32* microcontroller.

The project provides real-time data to help optimize plant watering, prevent over- or under-watering, and analyze environmental conditions.
